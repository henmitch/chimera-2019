Chimera states---the coexistence of synchrony and asynchrony in a nonlocally-coupled network of identical oscillators---are often used as a model framework for epileptic seizures.
The present study explores the dynamics of chimera states in a network of modified Hindmarsh-Rose neurons, configured to reflect the graph of the mesoscale mouse connectome.
Our model produced superficially epileptiform activity converging on persistent chimera states in a large region of a two-parameter space governing connections (a) between subcortices within a cortex and (b) between cortices.
The findings contribute to a growing body of literature suggesting mathematical models can qualitatively reproduce epileptic seizure dynamics.
