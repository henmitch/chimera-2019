Since focal seizures occur when a portion of the brain is firing synchronously while the rest fires asynchronously, chimera states---the coexistence of synchrony and asynchrony in a network of non-locally coupled oscillators--present a good model for this behavior.
We demonstrate the existence of chimera states in a model of the mouse brain, and explore how connection strengths between and within portions of the brain affect the presence of chimera states.
This is a step towards better understanding the physiological and dynamical causes of epileptic seizures.
