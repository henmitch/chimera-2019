The science and mathematics of synchronization are among history's most well-studied areas of research.
One of the earliest well-documented appearances of synchrony in unexpected places was observed in 1665 by Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens, the inventor of the pendulum clock.
He noticed that two clocks hung from the same beam would eventually synchronize with each other.
He supposed that this was due to minuscule energy transfers between the two clocks through the wooden beam.
This hypothesis was proven nearly 350 years later which shows that even the simplest-seeming synchronization behavior results from complex dynamics \cite{PenaRamirez2016}.

This behavior extends to larger systems than two clocks.
A classic demonstration in many classes on the mathematics of synchronization depicts the same phenomenon with more oscillators \cite{Pantaleone2002}.
One places a platform on top of a set of rollers, and places at least two metronomes on that platform (see \cref{fig:metronome_demo} for a drawing).
When these metronomes are started with the same frequency, out of phase with each other, over time their phases drift until they synchronize.

One example of more complex behavior arising from similar mechanisms is the coexistence of synchrony and asynchrony within a system of identical coupled oscillators, a phenomenon known as a \textit{chimera state} \cite{Kuramoto2002,Abrams2004}.
The existence of these chimera states are surprising, as they represent asymmetry within symmetric systems.
The first time this behavior was observed was in a ring of \textit{nonlocally coupled} oscillators \cite{Kuramoto2002}.
While global coupling is an all-to-all interaction and local coupling is a nearest-neighbor interaction, nonlocal coupling is a mixture of the two.
The model is expressible in one dimension as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:kuramoto}
  \pdv{t} A(x, t)
  =
  \pqty{1 + i \omega_{0}} A
  -
  \pqty{1 + i b} \abs{A}^{2} A
  +
  K \pqty{1 + i a} \pqty{Z(x, t) - A(x, t)}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:kuramoto_coupling}
  Z(x, t)
  =
  \int{G(x - x') A(x', t) \dd{x'}}
  \qand
  G(y)
  =
  \frac{\kappa}{2} e^{-k \abs{y}},
\end{equation}
which reduces to the phase equation
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:kuramoto_phase}
  \pdv{t} \phi(x, t)
  =
  \omega
  -
  \int{G(x - x') \sin(\phi(x, t) - \phi(x', t) + \alpha) \dd{x'}}
  \qq{where}
  \tan(\alpha)
  =
  \frac{b - a}{1 + a b}.
\end{equation}
We numerically simulated the Kuramoto system using a discrete approximation, and it quickly fell into a chimera state (\cref{fig:kuramoto_chimera}).

Since then, chimera states have been found in simpler systems still.
One of the simplest is the Abrams model, two populations of identical oscillators with a stronger coupling strength within the populations than between them \cite{Abrams2008}.
The equation describing this system is given as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:abrams}
  \dv{\theta_{i}^{\sigma}}{t}
  =
  \omega
  +
  \sum_{\sigma' = 1}^{2} \frac{K_{\sigma \sigma'}}{N_{\sigma'}} \sum_{j = 1}^{N_{\sigma'}} \sin(\theta_{j}^{\sigma'} - \theta_{i}^{\sigma} - \alpha)
  \qq{where}
  K
  =
  \bmqty{\mu & \nu \\ \nu & \mu}
  \qand
  \sigma \in \Bqty{1, 2}.
\end{equation}
In this model, $\mu$ represents the intra-population strength, and $\nu$ represents the inter-population strength, meaning $\mu > \nu$.
Time can be scaled such that $\mu + \nu = 1$.
If $\mu - \nu$ is not too large, and $\alpha$ is not too much less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$, then this system can produce chimera states.
\Cref{fig:abrams} shows a simulation of the Abrams model on two populations of 128 oscillators.

A similar system was also analyzed in the physical world \cite{Martens2013}.
Two swinging platforms were coupled together with springs of variable spring constant $\kappa$, and 15 metronomes---all tuned to the same frequency---were placed on each platform.
For a wide range of values of $\kappa$, all of the metronomes on one platform would synchronize, while the metronomes on other platform would remain asynchronous.
This system is directly analogous to the Abrams model.
The metronomes on the same platform are coupled through the motion of the swing, which heavily influences the motion of the metronomes.
This intra-community coupling is represented by $\mu$ in the Abrams model.
The metronomes on opposite platforms are coupled through the springs, which is a much weaker interaction, represented in the Abrams model by $\nu$.

While chimera states may present themselves obviously when observed in a plot or the physical world, they can be harder to pin down analytically.
One useful pair of measures for the presence of a chimera state are the \textit{chimera-like index} $\chimera$ and the \textit{metastability index} $\meta$ \cite{Shanahan2010,Hizanidis2016}.
We will investigate a system of $M$ communities of nonlocally-coupled oscillators, and we sample their phases at times $t \in \bqty{1, \ldots, T}$.
In order to develop these two measures, one must first develop the \textit{order parameter} $\ordparam(t) = \abs{\expval{e^{i \phase_{k}(t)}}_{k \in C}}$, where $\phase$ is the phase of oscillator $k$, and $\ev{f}_{k \in c}$ is the average of $f$ over all $k$ in community $C$.
$\ordparam$ indicates the instantaneous synchrony of a community (how similar the phases of the oscillators are to the others in $C$), and not its overall coherence (how similar the trajectories of the oscillators are).
From this, we find the two measures:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:chimera}
  \chimera
  &=
    \expval{\sigma_{\text{chi}}}_{T}
  &
    \qq{where}
    \sigma_{\text{chi}}(t)
  &=
    \frac{1}{M - 1} \sum_{c \in C}{\ordparam_{c}(t) - \expval{\ordparam_{c}}_{C}}^{2} \\
  \label{eq:metastability}
  \meta
  &=
    \expval{\sigma_{\text{met}}}_{C}
  &
    \qq{where}
    \sigma_{\text{met}}(c)
  &=
    \frac{1}{T - 1} \sum_{t \leq T}{\ordparam_{c}(t) - \expval{\ordparam_{c}}_{T}}^{2}
\end{align}
To put this into words, the metastability index is the average across communities of the variance of the order parameter within a given community over time, while the chimera-like index is the average over time of the variance of the order parameter across communities.

This gives us some maximum possible values for these measures \cite{Shanahan2010}.
If a community $c$ spends equal time in all stages of synchronization (i.e., the phase parameter of $c$ is uniformly distributed), then $\sigma_{\text{met}}(c)$ is at its maximum, the variance of the uniform distribution: $\meta_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{12}$.
If a community spends equal time in a maximally chimeric state and a minimally chimeric state, then its chimera-like index will be at its maximum\footnote{While it is possible for half of a system's communities to be synchronous and the other half asynchronous for all times (resulting in a chimera-like index of $\frac{2}{7}$), this is transient due to the effects of metastability \cite{Shanahan2010}.  Therefore, we will ignore this case.}: $\chimera_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{7}$.
Therefore, when the normalized chimera-like and metastability indices are presented, they will be presented normalized to $\frac{1}{7}$ and $\frac{1}{12}$, respectively.

Chimera states have been observed in many other systems, whether they be purely mathematical, biological, electrical, or mechanical \cite{Shanahan2010,Abrams2004,Andrzejak2016,Hizanidis2016,Kuramoto2002,Martens2013,Panaggio2015,Santos2015,Santos2017,Kruk2018,Xie2014}.
One of the most common ways that chimera states are talked about is in regards to seizures.
