The model used for this work was the modified Hindmarsh-Rose neural model\footnote{The modification is to add in the coupling, turning it into a network model instead of a single neuron.} taken from \cite{Santos2017}.
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:hr_x}
  \dot{\hrx}_{j}
  &=
    \hry_{j}
    -
    \hrx_{j}^{3}
    +
    b \hrx_{j}^{2}
    +
    I_{j}
    -
    \hrz_{j}
    -
    \frac{\hra}{n'_{j}} \sum_{k = 1}^{N} G'_{j k} \Theta_{j}(\hrx_{k})
    -
    \frac{\hrb}{n''_{j}} \sum_{k = 1}^{N} G''_{j k} \Theta_{j}(\hrx_{k}) \\
  \label{eq:hr_y}
  \dot{\hry}_{j}
  &=
    1
    -
    5 \hrx_{j}^{2}
    -
    \hry_{j} \\
  \label{eq:hr_z}
  \dot{\hrz}_{j}
  &=
    \mu \pqty{s \pqty{\hrx_{j} - \hrx_{\text{rest}}} - \hrz_{j}}
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hr_sigmoid}
  \Theta_{j}(\hrx_{k})
  =
  \frac{\hrx_{j} - \hrx_{\text{rev}}}{1 + e^{-\lambda \pqty{\hrx_{k} - \theta}}}
\end{equation}
is the sigmoidal activation function.
This activation function helps the model better approximate the behavior of neural masses, as opposed to specific neurons.
\Cref{tab:hr_params} shows the values and meanings of the symbols in the model.

This model was chosen due to the semanticity of its parameters, as well as its proven ability to exhibit chimera-like behavior as a neural mass model \cite{Santos2017}.
Additionally, the Hindmarsh-Rose model was not designed to emulate seizures, which provides further evidence for the theory that chimeras are a universal aspect of brain activity, as discussed in \cref{sec:lit_review_chimera_square_torus}.

It is worth noting that one of the limitations of this model is the changing nature of $\hra$ and $\hrb$ in the actual brain.
The strengths of connections and the amounts by which they are amplified vary in time.
However, they will be treated as constant, in order to present a view of parameter space.
