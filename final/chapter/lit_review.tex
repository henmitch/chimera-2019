It is important to get a sense of how the area of nonlinear dynamics has been applied to neuroscience.
One of the most powerful tools for describing the qualitative behavior of a nonlinear system is \textit{bifurcation analysis}, determining how the number and stability of fixed points and limit cycles changes as parameters of a model change \cite{Strogatz2015}.
