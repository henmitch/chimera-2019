The normalized chimera-like index of the entire physical region is shown in \cref{fig:aphysical_chimera}.
Near the maximal edge of the physical region, the highest values of the chimera index appear to follow a slope of $-1$.
It is unsurprising that chimera states would be prevalent when the coupling is large (out near the boundary of the aphysical range).

What is surprising, however, is the presence of the chimeric patch in the bottom left corner of \cref{fig:aphysical_chimera}, shown at a higher resolution in \cref{fig:zoom_chimera}.
Plotting the results of the simulations (\cref{fig:mean_058_010,fig:overhead_058_010}),
it is evident that this is not a calculation error, but is an actual feature of the parameter landscape.
