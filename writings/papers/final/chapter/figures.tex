  \caption[Additional figures]{Additional analyses of the parameter landscape.
    A.\ The number of runs (out of 10) which gave physical results.
    All parameter sets which are not yellow in A were excluded from the other analyses.
    B.\ The variance of the chimera-like index.
    C.\ The metastability index.
    D.\ The variance of the metastability index.
    E.\ The mean order parameter over time, averaged across runs.
    F.\ The variance between runs of the mean order parameter.
