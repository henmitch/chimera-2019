Mathematicians have observed the coexistence of synchronized and incoherent groups in coupled oscillator networks, known as ``chimera states.''
Recently, these models have been brought into theoretical neuroscience, where researchers are observing chimera states in simulations of animals' brains.
Many qualitative analogies have been drawn between chimera states collapsing into states of total synchrony and epileptic seizures, but quantitative evidence is lacking.
The goal of this project is to implement a coupled oscillator model on the human brain connectivity network, find the parameters of the model leading to chimera states, and observe whether their collapse matches data collected from human seizures.
