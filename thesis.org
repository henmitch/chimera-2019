* Meeting with Matt
  - See if there are models that cover going from syncrhony to chimera state (like a reverse collapse)
  - Look at global average/order parameter during chimera collapse
    - What kind of bifurcation does that look like?
    - Look at $r = \sum_{k}{e^{i \theta_{k}}}$ (or, look at mean $\theta$)
      - Time-delay embedding -> Often uses
  - Dynamical Sytems in Neuroscience - Izhekivich
  - Bump state
    - Bard Ehrmentraut (has worked with Strogatz)
    - Neurophysiological analog of chimera states
      - Allows for compartmentalization
  - Random forests to find attractors/predict basins of attraction -> PLoS Comp Bio
    - John Terry

   - Note: Video on slide 6 potentially distracting
     - Maybe have play once?
   - Note: Slide 9 & 10: s/chance/change/
   - Slide 13 - How's "job impact" quantified?
   - O*NET skills database?
   - Slide 14 - "Need" more purple
     - Not "have"?  Necessity seems kinda weird...
   - Skill complementarity - only pairwise?
   - Slide 19 - maybe have smaller version of colorized embedding from slide 18 (for reference)
   - Aesthetic: use LaTeX newcommand for function/measure names
   - Other fields not citing AI papers
     - Does this mean they aren't leveraging AI?  As analogy, a historian using a database system doesn't mean they cite that system.

*** Background
    We're talking about US equities markets: buying and selling stocks (largely computational).
    There are 13 "lit" exchanges, and O(40) of "dark" alternative systems which don't provide as much information publicly.
    There's a high rate of data exchange, one stream of which is governmentally mandated, the rest of which are proprietary.
    One can make a weighted directed graph out of the information flows.
    Note that geography does make a difference, as information moves at a finite speed (about \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} c)[fn:Wired_fiber_optics].

    One way to quantify information disparities is dislocations: the difference between the price reported on one feed and another feed.
    One can caltulate the opportunity cost from this dislocation.
*** [[https://compfi.org/][The research]]
    From the point of view of an observer in Carteret, NJ (home of the NYSE) in 2016, they analyzed the realized opportunity cost resulting from these information disparities.

    Dislocations occur a lot for the first 15 minutes of trading (starting at 9:30), then there are big spikes every half hour until noon.
    Then, there are not as many big spikes until 14:00, then there's a fairly large bump with a steady increase until trading closes at 16:00.
