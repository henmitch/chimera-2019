The goal for this work is to provide researchers and clinicians a reliable way to predict seizure occurrence in near-real time.
With the knowledge of measurable parameter values that set brains up for chimera states related to seizures, physicians and engineers could develop techniques to predict and prevent seizures \autocite{Taylor2014}.
Since around \SI{3}{\percent} of the United States population is diagnosed with epilepsy at some point in their lives, and many people without epilepsy experience isolated seizures, this is a problem whose solution would benefit many \autocite{Kandel2013}.
